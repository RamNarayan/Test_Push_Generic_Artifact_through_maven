Policies are always assigned to groups, and all group members inherit the assigned policy settings. While creating or editing a policy, you can configure the policy settings based on the needs of each group. Exactly how the policy settings are applied can vary depending on the operating system of a device.</para><para id="v110659362">This flexibility makes it easier to manage devices. You add a user to a group, and the user can self-enroll multiple devices of different types. All devices the user enrolls are governed by the same policy, which ensures that all the devices are protected with an equally strong policy. If you move a user to a different group, the policies that are assigned to the new group are applied.</para><para id="v110609919">
